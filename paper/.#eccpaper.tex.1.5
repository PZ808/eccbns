\section{Introduction}
\label{s:Introduction}  

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)
\cite{Barish:1999vh, 0264-9381-23-19-S03} 
has collected one year of coincident data at design sensitivity
\cite{Abbott:2009tt}, and upgrades to improve detector
sensitivity by a factor of two (and ultimately 10) are underway
\cite{0264-9381-26-11-114013}.  
Insprirals of compact binary systems have the potential to be a
promising source of gravitational waves for LIGO.
The search for inspiral signals uses the method of matched-filtering, in
which the time-series of the detector is cross-correlated against a
set of theoretical template waveforms.  The utility of this technique
rests on how well the template waveforms represent the actual signal, 
which has been a major impetus to calculate accurate waveforms.
Forthcoming results from numerical relativity are now being used to
compare methods for computing the waveform templates 
\cite{Boyle:2007ft,Boyle:2009dg,Buonanno:2009qa,Damour:2008te}. 

  Most template families, including those used by LIGO to search for
inspiral signals, make use of the \emph{quasi-circular} approximation. In this
scheme the binary system evolves adiabatically through a
sequence of circular orbits 
\cite{Damour:2000zb, Blanchet:2006zz, Martel:1999tm}. In an adiabatic inspiral,
the secular effects caused by emission of gravitational waves occur over
a time-scale much greater than the orbital time-scale.  For binaries
having evolved through the typical main sequence evolution scenario, the
radiation reaction will cause them to circularize by the time the
frequency of their gravitational waves enters the frequency band of the
detector \cite{Martel:1999tm, Peters:1964zz, Peters:1963ux}.  
%The effect of radiation reaction on the orbital elements was first investigated  .  
%The construction of accurate waveforms depends critically on an accurate %model of the phase evolution of evolution. 
%The of eccentric binaries under gravitational radiation was
%first calculated by Peters and Mathews \cite{Peters:1964zz,
%Peters:1963ux}. 

  Although most binaries are expected to have circularized before
they enter the band of the detector, there are scenarios that
predict the existence of residual eccentricities
\cite{O'Leary:2008xt,Wen:2002km}.  One such model predicts that black
hole (BH) binaries formed through the scattering of stellar mass black holes 
off a supermassive black hole (SMBH) occupying the center of a galaxy may form
with high eccentricities (90\% with $e_0 > 0.9$) \cite{O'Leary:2008xt}. The binary forms when two
individual black holes radiate enough energy during the encounter to
become a bound system. Estimates given in Ref.~\cite{O'Leary:2008xt}
suggest binaries formed in this manner may have event
rates of 1-100 yr$^{-1}$ for Advanced LIGO. In the dense central region
of globular cluster, binary-binary interactions may result in the
formation of a stable \emph{hierarchical triple}. If the the orbital planes are
highly inclined with respect to one another, Kozai resonance increase
the eccentricity of inner binary. It has been estimated that
30\% of these systems will have eccentricities \(e >0.1\) when they
enter the advanced LIGO frequency band ($\sim 10$ Hz) \cite{Wen:2002km}.  

 In recent years there has been a major effort to calculate the phase
evolution of post-Newtonian eccentric binaries to increasingly higher 
order \cite{Gopakumar:1997bs, Damour:2004bz, Konigsdorffer:2006zt}. 
The use of the method of variation of constants, a well known technique in celestial
mechanics, has provided new models which go beyond the adiabatic
approximation to include conservative post-Newtonian effects in the phase evolution \cite{Damour:2004bz}.  
The 3PN conservative contributions to phase evolution have been
derived in the quasi-Keplerian parameterization
\cite{Memmesheimer:2004cv} and the 3PN secular contribution should be
forthcoming given that the progress in flux calculations
\cite{Arun:2007sg}. 
  
  Despite the advancement in the phasing of eccentric binaries,
little has been done to investigate eccentric waveforms from a data analysis
perspective.  We expect this is due in large part to the conclusions of Martel
and Poisson \cite{Martel:1999tm}, who concluded that circular templates
were effective at capturing eccentric signals from sources evolving
adiabatically at leading order in radiation reaction.  However, their
results recently been challenged on the basis that the neglected the
conservative contributions to the orbital phase \cite{Tessmer:2007jg}.
In this paper we investigate the ability of circular SPA templates
to detect a set eccentric post-Newtonian waveforms which include
3PN conservative dynamics and agree with numerical simulations.
Our purpose is to quantify the utility of circular stationary phase 
templates as matched filters for gravitational wave signals emitted from 
binaries evolving along eccentric orbits

\subsection{Conservative post-Newtonian Dynamics}
\label{s:ConservativeDynamics}
             
% Newtonian
% Orbital precession does not occur in the Newtonian evolution model.
The post-Newtonian model can be understood more easily if we first
consider the evolution of two point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ in the purely
Newtonian case.  In the Newtonian case, conservative of energy $E$ and
angular momentum $J$ dictate the evolution of the orbital elements.
We define the \emph{mean motion} $n$ in terms of the orbital period $P$, \( n =
\frac{2 \pi}{P} \).  In the case of elliptic motion ($0<e<1$) $n$ is
simply the frequency, such that \( n = \sqrt{M/a^3} \) \footnote{We work
in units with \(G=c=1\)}. In general, the orbital eccentricity $e$ and the mean
motion $n$ alone do not suffice to determine the dynamics. To
parameterize our equations we introduce the eccentric anomaly $u$. When written in
terms of $u$ the relative orbital separation $r$ and the angular
frequency $\dot{\phi}$ take the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  r &=& a \left[1 - e \cos u \right], \\
    \dot{\phi} &=& \frac{n \sqrt{1 - e^2}}{{\left[1 - e \cos u
    \right]}^2}.
  %\phi &=& 2 \arctan \left[{\left(\frac{1+e}{1-e} \right)}^{1/2}
  %\tan \frac{u}{2} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
%
To complete the dynamical system we relate the eccentric anomaly to the
mean motion $n$ via the Classical Kepler Equation 
%
\beq
  l = u - e \sin u, \label{ClassicalKepler}
\eeq
%
where the \emph{mean anomaly} $l$ is given by \( \dot{l} = n \).
Recall that in the conservative case, $n$ is time-independent, such that
\( l = n\,(t - t_0) \).  These equations form the Keplerian
parameterization of a Newtonian orbit. Given initial conditions \(
\phi_0 \equiv \phi(t_0) \) and \( l_0 \equiv l(t_0) \) along with
numerical values for $e$ and $u$ we can compute the trajectories of the
particles at any time \(t > t_0 \) by root finding for $u$.  

  The post-Newtonian dynamics of a system are said to be conservative if they
the respect conservation of energy and angular momentum. Using the
relations given in Ref.~\cite{Memmesheimer:2004cv} for $n$ and $e$ in
terms of $E$ and $J$, one can derive 3PN qusi-keplerian equations of
motion by introducing three eccentricities $e_t,\,e_r$ and $e_{\phi}$,
to account for the variations in $t$, $r$, and $\phi$. The addition of
higher order conservative PN corrections lead a precession of the
periapsis.  We let $\Delta \phi$ represent the angle of precession
during one period P.  The angle swept out over consecutive periapsis
passages is defined 
%
\beq
  \omega = \frac{2\pi + \Delta\phi}{P} 
\eeq
%
\cite{Arun:2007rg, Arun:2007sg, Hinder:2008kv}. We note that \( \omega
\) is a constant in the absence of radiation reaction.

We employ post-Newtonian formalism outlined in Ref.~\cite{Hinder:2008kv}.
In this model, all post-Newtonian quantities are given in terms of a orbital
related variable $x = (M\omega)^{2/3}$ and the time eccentricity $e_t$.
 
 The evolution equations in the conservative dynamics \cite{Hinder:2008kv} take the abbreviated form
%
\beqa
  \frac{r}{M} &=& \left(1-e_t \cos u \right)x^{-1} 
    + r_{1\mathrm{PN}} + r_{2\mathrm{PN}}x \no
    & + & r_{3\mathrm{PN}} x^2 + \mathcal{O}(x^{3}), \\
%
  M\dot{\phi} &=& \frac{\sqrt{1-e_t^2}}{{\left(1-e_t \cos u \right)}^2}x^{3/2} 
    + \dot{\phi}_{1\mathrm{PN}}x^{5/2} + \dot{\phi}_{2\mathrm{PN}} x^{7/2} \no
    & + & \dot{ \phi }_{3 \mathrm{PN}} x^{ 5/2 } + \mathcal{O}(x^{11/2}), \\
%
l & = & u - e_t \sin u + l_{2\mathrm{PN}}x^2 +
l_{ 3\mathrm{PN} } x^3 + \mathcal{O}(x^{4}), \label{PnKepler} \\
%
  M\dot{l} & = &  Mn = x^{3/2} + n_{1\mathrm{PN}}x^{5/2} +
    n_{2\mathrm{PN}}x^{7/2} \label{MeanMotion} \\
    & + & n_{3\mathrm{PN}}x^{9/2} + \mathcal{O}(x^{11/2}).
\eeqa
%
The full expressions for the PN coefficients are given in the appendix
of Ref.~\cite{Hinder:2008kv}. We note that the PN coefficients
$r_{\mathrm{PN}},\,\dot{\phi}_{\mathrm{PN}}, \ldots $ are functions of both $e_t$
and $u$, whereas $n$ depends on $e_t$ alone.  To describe the motion of
the binary the conservative dynamics, we integrate \eqref{MeanMotion}
and numerically solve \eqref{PnKepler} for $u$ at each time step $t$. 

% Sub-Section: Reactive Dynamics
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Radiative post-Newtonian Dynamics}
\label{s:ReactiveDynamics}

  The radiative post-Newtonian dynamics are used to described the
evolution of the system over timescales during which angular momentum
and energy are carried away for the system by gravitation radiation.
%The standard way to 
The time dependence of $E$ and $J$ implies that $n$ and $e_t$ are
no longer integrals of the motion. Their time variation
contributes to the secular variations in $r$ and $\dot{\phi}$
Thus, the equations for the coordinate motion
of the binary must be extended into the non-conservative regime to include the secular effects on the
orbital elements $\dot{\phi}$, $r$, and $l$ entering through the
variable $x$ and $e_t$.  The 2PN equations describing the radiative
dynamics read
%
\footnote{We adhere to a convention
in the GW literature, where the radiative PN order is defined relative
the order at which radiation reaction occurs.}   
%
\beqa
  M\dot{x} & = & \frac{ 2 \eta }{ 15 \left( 1 - e_t^2 \right) } 
  \left( 96 + 292 e_t^2 + 37e_t^4 \right) x^5 
  + \dot{x}_{\mathrm{1PN}} x^6 \nonumber \\
  & + & \dot{x}_{\mathrm{1.5PN}} x^{13/2}
  + \dot{x}_{\mathrm{2PN}} x^7 + \mathcal{O}(x^{15/2}), \label{Mdxdt} \\
%
  M\dot{e_t} & = & \frac{ -e_t \eta }{ 15 \left( 1 - e_t^2 \right)^{7/2} } 
  \left( 304 + 121 e_t^2 \right) x^4 
  + \dot{e}_{\mathrm{1PN}} x^5  \nonumber \\
  & + & \dot{e}_{\mathrm{1.5PN}} x^{11/2} + \dot{e}_{\mathrm{2PN}} x^{6}
  + \mathcal{O}(x^{13/2}), \label{Mdedt} 
\eeqa
%
where \( \eta \equiv \mu / M = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2)  \).
Again, we refer our readers to the appendix of Ref.~\cite{Hinder:2008kv}
where they may find the complete expressions of PN coefficients. 
In the adiabatic approximation, there PN coefficients are independent
of $u$, and thus can be solved independently of the Kepler Equation. We
use a 4th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF-45) with adaptive step-size control to
numerically solve the radiation reaction ODE system at each time $t >
t_0$. Once $x(t)$ and $e(t)$ are obtained, we substitute their values
into \eqref{MeanMotion} and solve the ODE for $l(t)$. This value is
then equated to the RHS of \eqref{PnKepler}, giving us our PN
Kepler Equation. We then solve the PN Kepler Equation using
the Mikkola root finding method \cite{1987CeMec..40..329M}. 
The values of $x$, $e_t$, and $u$ are
then substituted into the conservative equations for $r$ and
$\dot{\phi}$. The value of $\dot{r}$  is obtained numerically using a
five-point stencil method and the phase $\phi$ is numerically integrated
using the RKF-45. Repeating this process, we obtain the dynamics
$(r,\, \dot{r},\, \phi,\, \dot{\phi})$ at each time $t>t_0$.

% Sub-Section: Eccentric Binary Waveforms
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Eccentric Binary Waveforms}
\label{s:EccentricWaveforms}

Let us now discuss the eccentric waveforms that we used for our signals
in the template bank simulations. In this study, we restrict ourselves
to the dominant harmonic only.  
The leading order time domain gravitational-wave
polarizations are given by the following expressions:
%
\bs
\beqa
  h_+ &=& \frac{-M\eta}{R}\, \biggl \{ 
    (1+{\cos}^2 \iota) 
      \biggl [ 
        \biggl ( \frac{M}{r} + r^2 \dot{\phi}^2 - \dot r^2 
        \biggr ) 
      \cos2\phi \no 
      &+& 2 r \dot r \dot{\phi} \, \sin 2\phi
      \biggr ] + \,
      \biggl [ 
        \frac{M}{r} -r^2 \dot{\phi}^2 -\dot r^2 
      \biggr ]
    \biggr \} \,, \label{hplus} \\
%
  h_{\times} &=& \frac{-2 M \eta}{R} \cos\iota\, \biggl \{
    \biggl ( 
      \frac{M}{r} + r^2 \dot{\phi}^2 - \dot{r}^2
    \biggr ) 
    \sin2\phi \no
    && - 2 r \dot{r} \dot{\phi} \cos2\phi 
    \biggr \}\,, \label{hcross}
\eeqa
\es
%
where  $R$ is the radial distance of binary, and $\iota$ is the inclination angle of the orbital plane of
the binary measured from the line of sight \cite{Damour:2004bz,
Thorne:1987af}. The full waveform $h(t)$ is a linear combination of the
$+$ and $\times$ polarizations:
%
\beqa
  h(t) &=& F_{+}(\theta,\,\varphi,\psi) h_{+}(t;\, \iota,\, \beta) \no
    &+& F_{\times}(\theta,\,\varphi,\psi) h_{\times}(t;\, \iota,\, \beta)
  \label{hoft}
\eeqa
%
where $F_+$ and $F_{\times}$ are the beam-pattern factors of the
detector and $\beta$ is the other Euler angle of the source
\footnote{We set $\beta=0$}. For ground based intereferometers, the beam factors are
expressed in terms of the Euler angles for the detector $(\theta,\,
\varphi)$  and the Euler angle of the polarization plane $\psi$.
Following the convention of Ref.~\cite{Thorne:1987af}, the expressions for
the beam-pattern factors read
%
\bs
\begin{align}
F_{+}(\theta,\varphi,\psi) &= \frac{1}{2} \left(1+{\cos}^2\theta\right) \cos2\varphi           
\cos2\psi \no
&-\cos\theta \sin2\varphi \sin 2\psi, \\
F_{\times} (\theta,\varphi,\psi) &= \frac{1}{2}\left(1+{\cos}^2\theta\right)+\cos\theta
\cos2\varphi\cos2\psi
\end{align}
\es
%
In computing the waveforms, we set the angles such that the binary is
optimally orientated for the $+$ polarization mode; i.e, we set
$F_{+}=1$ and $F_{\times}=0$.

\section{Data Analysis}
\label{s:DataAnalysis}

 So far we have limited ourselves to discussing the dynamics of
eccentric binary systems, instead of the implications for detecting these
systems.  We now turn to the question of whether ground based detectors,
such as LIGO, can detect eccentric binaries using circular templates. 
LIGO currently uses 2PN TaylorF2 circular templates to search
for coalescing compact binaries in the mass range $M \leq 35 M_{\odot}$
\cite{Abbott:2009tt}. These templates 
use the stationary phase approximation (SPA) to obtain a Fourier domain
signal of the form
%
\beq
\tilde{h}(f) = A(f) f^{-7/6} e^{ i \left( \Psi(f) - \pi/4 \right) },
\eeq 
%
where $\Psi(f)$ is the Fourier phase \cite{Damour:2000zb, Babak:2006ty}.
The SPA templates are desirable becuase they have a direct analytic
frequency domain representation and they are inexpensive to compute.

% Sub-Section: Template Bank
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Template Bank Description}
\label{s:TheBank}
  %In this section we describe some of the basic elements of the template bank
  In this section we describe the template bank
used in our simulations. The template wavefomrms are
frequency-domain stationary phase approximation templates of the form
%
\beq
\tilde{h}(f) = A(f) f^{-7/6} e^{ i \left( \Psi(f) - \pi/4 \right) },
\eeq 
%
where $A(f)$ is an amplitude term, $\Psi(f)$ is a Fourier phase which
includes the post-Newtonian
terms \cite{Damour:2000zb, Babak:2006ty}.
The template waveforms are arranged hexagonally \cite{hexagonal} 
to cover the mass range $ 1 \leq m_1,\,m_2 \leq 35$ subject to $ M \leq
35 $. The template waveforms, denoted by $h$, are normalized such that 
$ \bra h \mid h \ket  = 1,$ where $\bra\,\mid\,\ket$ denotes the matched filtering
inner-product. Given a signal $s(t)$ and template $h(t)$ having
well defined fourier transforms, we define the matched-filtering
inner product as 
%
\beqa
  \bra s \mid h \ket & = & 2\, \Re \int_{0}^{\infty} \ud f\,
    \frac{ {\tilde{s}}^*(f) \tilde{h}(f) +
      \tilde{s}(f) {\tilde{h}}^*(f) }
           { S_n (|f|) }, \no
%
        & = & 4 \, \Re \int_{0}^{\infty} \ud f\, 
    \frac{ {\tilde{s}}^*(f) \tilde{h}(f) }
     { S_n (|f|) },  
  \label{InnerProduct}
\eeqa
%
where $\tilde{s}(f)$ denotes the Fourier transform of $s(t)$, 
\beq
  \tilde{s}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ud t\, e^{-2\pi i f t} s(t),
\eeq
and $S_n(|f|)$ is the one-side noise power spectral
density (PSD) of the detector. 
The template parameters are divided into two categories: extrinsic and
intrinsic. The extrinsic parameters are those which can be maximized
without the need of a template bank.
The extrinsic parameters in our model are the time-of-arrival
parameter, $t_C$, and phase-of-arrival parameter denoted $\phi_C$
The intrinsic parameters of the templates are their
the chirptimes $\tau_0$ and $\tau_3$ \cite{Babak:2006ty}.
The pairs $(\tau_0,\,\tau_3)$ may be inverted to obtain the mass
parameters $(\mathcal{M},\, \eta)$ of the template.  
The template parameters are thus given by the set of values
%
\beq
 \vec{\theta} = ( t_C,\, \phi_C;\, \tau_0,\, \tau_3 ).
\eeq
%
%that ``picks out'' the frequencies at which the instrument
%is most sensitive. 
%
Using Eq.~\eqref{InnerProduct}, we define the overlap function $M$, as
the maximum of over the extrinsic parameters of the normalized signals,
%
\beqa
   M & = & \max_{ t_C,\,\phi_C } \,
     \frac{ \bra s \mid h \ket }{ \sqrt{ \bra s \mid s \ket \bra h \mid h \ket } }, \no 
%
     & = & \max_{ t_C,\,\phi_C }\, \bra \vs \mid \vh \ket,
  \label{Match}
\eeqa
\cite{Owen:1995tm, Owen:1998dk}.
The maximization over the extrinsic
parameters $t_C$ and $\phi_C$ is accomplished using an FFT
\cite{Owen:1995tm}. 
%We note that the inner product above is well defined over the function space of signals obeying the Dirichlet conditions and having unit norm.
%The intrinsic parameters of the template are those which are searched over.
The templates are spaced
such that the loss in signal in no greater than a minimal match
\cite{Lindblom:2008cm} of 0.97.
The fitting factor $\FF$, \cite{Apostolatos:1994mx}
quantifies loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to
filtering a signal with template that is not an optimal filter
\cite{Apostolatos:1994mx}.
The loss in event rate incurred by
non-optimal filtering is proportional to $1-{\FF}^3$, meaning a 3\%
decrease in $\FF$ gives about 10\% loss in events.

The is $\FF$ obtained by
maximizing the match function over a (continuous) set of intrinsic template parameters 
$\{ \vartheta^{\,b} \}$,
%
\beq
  \bar{\mathcal{F}} = \max_{\mathcal{M},\, \eta} \max_{ t_C, \, phi_C}  
              \bra \hat{s} \mid \hat{h} \ket\,.
  \label{FitFact}
\eeq
%
In our simulations the relavent quantitiy is the bank maximized fitting
factor. Following Ref.~\cite{Lindblom:2008cm}, we define the \emph{effective
fitting factor} $\bar { \mathcal{F} } $
\beq
  \bar { \mathcal{F} } = \max_{ \hat{h}\,\in\,\mathrm{bank} } \bra
\hat{s} \, \mid \, \hat{h} \ket
  \label{EffFitFact}
\eeq
  The function $\bar { \mathcal{F} }$ provides a measure of the
how effective the waveforms used to construct template bank are at
capturing a signal $s$.
The distribution of $\bar { \mathcal{F} }$ also isolates the region
of the parameter space where the mismatch is less than the
required threshold value.
%We will use Eqs.~(\eqref{Match},\,\eqref{Mbank}) to discuss our simulations in Sec.~\ref{s:Results}.

We set the lower frequency cut $f_L$ for the templates at 40 Hz for
initial LIGO (iLIGO) and 10 Hz for advanced LIGO (advLIGO). 
The upper frequency cut-off $f_U$ for the
templates is set to 2048 Hz. The mass range of the template bank is
the same as the range for the low mass search \cite{Abbott:2009tt}, namely
$ 1 \leq M/M_{\odot} \leq 35 $. The sampling rate is set to 4096 Hz.

We ran the bank simulation code (cite LAL?) with the TaylorF2 templates at 2.0PN and

the iLIGO bank simulations was $10\,026$. The mass range of the signals
was  $ 1 \leq M/M_{\odot} \leq 15 $, which is justified by the decrease in
duration due to the presence of eccentricity \cite{Martel:1999tm, Cokelaer:2009hj}. 
The range of initial eccentricities is $ 0 \leq e_0 \leq 0.4 $. The
cutoff frequency of the eccentric signals is set the the Schwarzschild
innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), $f_{\mathrm{isco}} = 1 / \left(6
\sqrt{6} \pi M\right)$

simulations using the initial LIGO noise spectrum.

\subsection{Results for Initial LIGO}
\label{s:iLIGOResults}
In this section we present the results of our
template bank simulations wherin the initial LIGO noise PSD
was used for $S_n(f)$. The expression PSD (in Hz$^{-1/2}$ has the form
%
\beq
   S_n(f) = (4.49 x)^{-56} + 0.16 x^{-4.52} + 0.52 + 0.32 x^2,
\eeq
%
where $x = f/150$ and $f$ is the frequency in Hz.
% this is qm's ligo_psd( f ) 
%I need some more information, becuase this gets multiplied by 
% 9.0e-46 * DYN_RANGE_FAC * DYN_RANGE_FAC to give the actual number for 
% a given frequency

To understand the degree to which eccentricity affects the
characteristics of the waveform, we investigated the
overlap as a function of eccentricity using a circular $x$-model signal
as our ``template''.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:SELFolaps} we present the results
of the overlap computations for three different mass ratios.  The
overlaps tend to be more sensitive to eccentricity for smaller mass
systems. The
curves displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:SELFolaps} are best understood in
terms of how the duration of the signal is influenced by the total mass
$M$ and the initial eccentricity $e_0$.  It is evident from
Fig.~\ref{fig:waves}, that higher eccentricities lead to shorter
waveforms for a given mass ratio.  Increasing the mass of the system
also decreases the duration of waveform. 
%
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/match_SELF}
\caption{ \label{fig:SELFolaps} The overlap $(s_{e\,=\,0}\,|s)$ for three
systems having total masses
$ (1.4 + 1.4) M_{\odot},\, (1.4 + 5.0) M_{\odot} $ and $(1.4 + 10)
M_{\odot} $.
Here, $s_{ e\,=\,0 }$ denote the circular ``template'' and $s$ is the $x$-model
eccentric signal. The higher mass system is less effected by
eccentricity because the shortening of the duration due to the
eccentricity is offset by inherent decrease in duration with increased
mass. However, the two effects are not close enough in magnitude to
cancel out one another. Thus, higher eccentricities lead to a de-phasing
which results in a low overlap. }
\end{figure}
%
% Discussion of Overlap Plots
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now, let us discuss the results of the match computations in which we
only maximized over the extrinsic quantities $t_C$ and $\phi_C$.  We
calculated the match integral for $e_0 \in [0,\,0.5]$ for mass ratios
$(1.4 + 1.4) M_{\odot},\, (1.4 + 5.0) M_{\odot},\,$ and $(1.4 + 10) M_{\odot}$. 
For the 2PN SPA templates, we find that
the $x$-model disagrees with the SPA model over the whole range of
eccentricities.  Notice, however, that the value of $M$ increases with
increasing mass. This is because higher masses have shorter signal
durations and the presence of \ecc decreases the length of the inspiral 
\cite{Peters:1963ux, Peters:1964zz, Martel:1999tm}. In the case of the
3.5PN SPA templates, the matches are slightly improved, but are still
especially poor for the 1.4+1.4 system.  The 1.4+5.0 system matches the
SPA quite well when $e_0 \leq 0.01 $, with $M \sim 95\% $. 

%
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/match_SPA}
\caption{\label{fig:SPAolaps} The match integral $M$ is 
shown as a function of initial eccentricity
for three different configurations of the component masses.
The upper plot shows the match of the eccentric signal against the 2PN
SPA waveforms for $h$ and 3.5PN templates are used in the lower plot.
Notice that the effect of eccentricity is less severe for 3.5PN
templates than the 2PN templates.}
\end{figure}
%

% Discussion of Contour Plots
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now we present the results of the template bank simulations, for which
we optimize over the full bank to get the best match. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:match2p0Mt}, we show contours of constant $M_B$ in the
$(M,e_0)$ plane for the 2PN run. Notice that we have gained a significant
amount in overlap from the bank simulation. 
With the 2PN templates, the region of the parameter space
where the (bank maximized) match is 96\% or better is $M/M_{\odot} \geq
3.5$ and $ e_0 \leq 0.05 $. In Fig.~\ref{fig:match3p5Mt}, we show the
distribution of $M_B$ for the simulation using the 3.5PN template bank.
Interestingly, the 3.5PN bank does not do as well as the 2PN bank,
despite the fact that
the 3.5PN un-maximized matches were higher than the 2PN (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:SPAolaps}).  Although the 2PN bank does better overall, the
3.5PN bank is more efficient for low masses $M \sim M_{\mathrm{BNS}}
\sim 2.8 M_{\odot} $.

\section{Consistency Check}
\label{s:AppAcheck}
In this appendix we give a brief summary of the checks we
performed on our code. Our main consistency check was the reproduction
of the results of Refs.~\cite{Martel:1999tm}. 
To do this, we wrote a double precision 
\footnote{The results of Ref.~\cite{Martel:1999tm} were obtained using single
precision arithmetic, resulting in large accumulation of phase error.
Regardless, their qualitative conclusions have been shown to hold
\cite{Cokelaer:2009hj}.}
evolution code to numerically solve the ODE system given in
Ref.~\cite{Martel:1999tm}, which we will call the $p$-model in reference
to variable $p$ used in their ODE system, at double precision. Using the phase
evolution, we computed the leading order (``restricted'')
waveforms given in Ref.~\cite{Wahlquist:1987rx}. We then computed the overlaps
between the Newtonian order waveforms obtained using the x-model and
the waveforms using the model in Ref.~\cite{Martel:1999tm} 
In our comparisons we choose to use only the dominant harmonic. We
find excellent agreement (see figure olap\_x00VSp\_2.8msun.png for
qm.td\_td\_match overlaps and figure FFs\_xmod00\_pmod\_0spa for fitting factors against
the SPA waveforms)

% CHOPPED MATERIAL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Let us consider a deterministic signal $s(t)$ of known form and assume
%that it is contained in
%the detector output $o(t)$ such that $ o(t) = s(t) + n(t) $, where $n(t)$ is
%a non-deterministic function of time 
% i.e. a random process with spectral density $S_n(f)$
%characterizing the noise content in the
%output.  For simplicity, we take $n(t)$ to be stationary Gaussian
%noise. If $s$ is taken to be a gravitational-wave signal, the we must
%also introduce a set of k parameters $ \{ \vta \}_{\,a=0,\,\ldots,\,k-1} $ that determine the
%signal content. The problem we face is that the signal parameters are not
%known a priori.  However, we do have information about the range of
%possible values for the signal parameters. To solve the problem, we
%construct a large collection of template waveforms to cover
%parameter space called a template bank. 
%More formally, a template bank $\mathcal{T}$ is a
%discrete space represented by a set of model waveforms
%$ \{ h( t; \, \vta_j) \}_{\,j=0,\,1\,\ldots,\,N_B - 1} $, where
%$ \vta_j $ is the set of signal parameters characterizing the
%$ j^{ \text{th} } $ template, and $N_B$ is the total number of templates
%in the bank \cite{Babak:2006ty, Cokelaer:2009hj, Owen:1995tm, Owen:1998dk}.
