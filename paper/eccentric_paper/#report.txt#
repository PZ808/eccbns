"The Effect of Eccentricity on Searches for Gravitational-Waves from
Coalescing Compact Binaries in Ground-based Detectors" presents a more
thorough assessment of the ability of existing searches of LIGO data
to detect signals from coalescing binaries in moderately eccentric
orbits than is found in previous analyses. Compact binaries with
modest residual orbital eccentricity when the orbital frequency enters
the LIGO band plausibly form a substantial fraction of the population
of detectable compact binary systems, so it is important to understand
the ability of current searches to detect such systems. Furthermore,
advanced LIGO, which is currently under construction, will have
sensitivity at lower frequencies and searches will be more susceptible
to the effects of orbital eccentricity on the gravitational waveform;
this paper makes a first effort to understand the degree to which the
current searches will need to be modified for future searches of
Advanced LIGO data. Therefore, I recommend that this paper be
published in Physical Review D.

We agree the evolution is not adiabatic, as energy is being radiated away
from the system in GWs.  We have changed adiabatically to secularly.

The extra "with" has been removed.

We have moved this sentence to section 2d, where it follows the
sentence stating we are only using the dominant harmonic for our waveforms.

This is a general expression for the leading order quadrupolar waveform.  If
the orbit is circular, the \dot{r} = 0, and \frac{Gm}{r} = r^2 \dot\phi^2 from
the centripetal accel.  With these simplifications, the \sin^2 \iota piece
vanishes and it reduces to the more often cited circular h_+ expression.     
As a double check, we have carefully gone through the derivation given in Gopakumar and Iyer PRD
65 084011 (2002) and were able to reproduce the non-oscillatory part by
factorizing the expanded form of Eq 2.4a therein.

The text has been changed to be consistent with figure caption.

The axes have been re-scaled such that they are the same for both panels.

We have removed the Re from the 1st integral of Eq. (21) and the |f|'s have
been changed to f in denominators.

This now reads  1 \leq m_1,\,m_2 \leq 34 M_\odot.

In our code we had a dynamic range scaling factor in the PSDs.
We forgot to divide this out when writing the paper. 
This has been fixed and units for frequency have been added to the divisors of
$f$.

You are correct.  In the revised caption, we emphasize the that higher mass
system are shorter and therefore have less time to lose phase coherence with
the eccentric signals.

This has been revised to read:
"Notice that the overlap values increase with
increasing mass. This is because higher mass systems spend less time in
the detectors band and therefor have less time to de-phase with the
Taylor F2 templates."

The total mass spans 2 \leq M \leq 15, not 1 solar mass to 15 solar masses. 
This has been corrected.
The c.f. has been changed to cf.

We believe this is due to differences in the order of the PN approximations used to model
the waveforms and the templates. 
The lower overlap for M=10.0 solar masses at zero eccentricity is
because it is more massive and PN effects scale with the mass. At around
e_0 = 0.2, the 6.4 Msun waveform gets worse because it is accumalating more
GW cycles which results in the loss of phase coherence.
This explanation has been added to the text.

Originally, we plotted chirp mass against initial eccentricity, but found that
the contour lines were jagged due to the strong dependence of both chirp mass
and eccentricity on the symmetric mass ratio \eta. 
The jaggedness of the isocontours affected the readability of the results so we
decided to go with total mass instead.
The problem is that we are
trying to plot a 3-d parameter space on a 2-d plot.  To deal with this and to illustrate the effect
of mass ratio we plot the best, mean, and worst fitting factor.

The labels have been enlarged and set inside small boxes to increase the contrast.

> Section V: change "et. al." to "et al.".

We have made this change.
